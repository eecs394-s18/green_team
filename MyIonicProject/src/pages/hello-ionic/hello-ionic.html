  <h3>Welcome to Common Culture!</h3>

  <p>
    Our project connects international students to local studetns at the university they will be attending on an exchange program.
  </p>
  <p>
    Providing conversation topics based on common interests and a local translator module to help with communication, our webapp helps international students assimilate quicker, and helps local studetns learn about foreign cultures, and possibly enhance their foreign language capabilities.
